It allows to test for existence of any seasonal patterns against the broad null hypothesis of no seasonality and to isolate most prominent seasonal cycles while using harmonic mean p-values to control for multiple testing. The proposed test has numerous applications in time series analysis. As an example, it is applied to identify seasonal patterns in 76 national stock markets and 772 cryptocurrency markets to detect trading cycles, determine their length, and test the weak-form efficient market hypothesis. Cryptocurrency markets are shown to be less efficient than national stock markets, with predominantly irregular seasonality periodicity that cannot be reduced to conventional weekly, monthly, or annual cycles.},

Testing the robustness of seasonal anomalies in emerging markets would first, help to examine the theoretical explanations that have been proposed and second, provide an out-of-sample result for these seasonality anomalies. This study examines the efficiency of advanced emerging markets by testing five seasonal anomalies: the month of the year, other January, day-of-the-week, holiday, and week 44. Evidence is reported that is consistent with all of these seasonal anomalies with the exception of the other January effect; supporting the argument that advanced emerging markets are less than perfectly efficient.},

However, their distribution theory under the null hypothesis assumes that the series in question has short memory; that is, its partial sum satisfies an invariance principle. This paper shows that the KPSS test is consistent against stationary long memory alternatives, such as I(d) processes for d ϵ (−12, 12, d ≠ 0. It can therefore be used to distinguish short memory and long memory stationary processes. The power of the KPSS test in finite samples is found to be comparable to that of Lo's modified rescaled range test. The results show that a rather large sample size, such as T = 1000, will be necessary to distinguish reliably between a long memory process and a short memory process with comparable short-term autocorrelation.}

This paper is concerned with the selecting optimal number of lags H in Ljung–Box test such that the actual size of the test does not exceed the test’s level while the power of the test does not fall under specific value. A simulation study is employed to investigate the effect of selecting an improper values of H on the actual size and power of the Ljung–Box test. The results confirm that an optimal value of H depends on the time series’ length as well as the test’s level. The comparison results with currently used approaches in the literature confirm that the commonly used techniques are not suggesting a proper value for H.}
