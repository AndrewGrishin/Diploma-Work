	abstract="A one-step optimization procedure is suggested for parameter estimation in autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) processes. Comparisons are made between the proposed procedure and the well known two-step procedure of Haslett and Raftery (1989) using simulation results. The invertibility condition is handled by a convenient transformation. The optimization procedure is performed using the simulated annealing method.",
